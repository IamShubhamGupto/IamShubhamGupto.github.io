Hey there! Welcome to my personal site (always under development) where I try to document most of my previous and ongoing work. I'm a software developer passionate about solving Computer Vision problems. You can read about my published work in the <b><a href='publications/'> publications </a></b> tab. 

Im currently pursuing Masters in Computer Engineering at New York University and <b>actively seeking internships for summer 2023!</b> I am looking for software development roles and research assistant positions for projects related to representation learning. I am available for work between May and September 2023.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
